Hello, student of School21!ðŸ˜‰

To make it easier for you to navigate the material, we have prepared a list of topics that you will learn in this project. 

We will study: 
- basic data structures: list, map, queue, set, stack, vector;
- classes in C++;
- overloading constructors/methods/operators;
- iterators;
- class templates.

Now, knowing what awaits you in this project, you can slowly begin to study the topics listed above.ðŸ˜‡
